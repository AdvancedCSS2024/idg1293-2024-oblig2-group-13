i ended up putting the SVG's directly in html as i wanted to minimize the CSS that originaly was included in the svgs.
i also ended up retracing some of the svgs and using simplify in ilustrator to optimize the SVG's.
After that i manually went in and removed the un needed tags from the svgs aswell as combining styles for reuse.
This approach should help minimize the total footprint of the poster page but the approach can seem a bit exesive.

There are many spesific styles that would probably be faster to do with in-line styling but i wanted to separate them out
to make the page more manitnance friendly.
